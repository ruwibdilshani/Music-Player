# Music-Player
The Music Player web application is a simple yet functional platform for playing a list of songs. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a user-friendly interface to control playback, adjust volume, and navigate through the playlist. The project is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
